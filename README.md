# The_method_of_least_squares  
Software implementation of the approximation of the functions given in the table by the method of least squares.  
  
In the software implementation, we took {1, x, x^2, ..., x^m } as a system of linearly independent functions  
The result of the program performs:  
1. Outputs the graph of the given function and the obtained approximation (polynomial of degree ).  
2. Outputs the graphs of the two interpolation polynomials from the previous task.  
3. Calculates and compares the errors in the norm of space for the generalized polynomial constructed by the method described above  
4. and two interpolation polynomials (using quadrature formulas to choose from).
